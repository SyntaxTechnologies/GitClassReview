Cucumber Class 1

Cucumber:
is an automation tool which supports BDD(behavioral driven development)

BDD is an Agile software development process that creates a collaboration between QAs, developers and any non-technical team members

Cucumber uses a language called gherkin, which makes our test cases look in plain English

Gherkin keywords:
Given: precondition
When: action
Then: result/outcome
And: continuation of the steps above (given, when, then)

As a user I must be able to login to HRMS application with valid given
credentials

Given navigate to HRMS login page
When enter valid credentials
And click on login button
Then verify dashboard logo is displayed
And verify username is correct

BaseClass --> starting point

PageInitializer - initialize our objects

CommonMethods --> common functions

In order to write a test case in cucumber you will need feature file.

To have a feature file, you have to create a file with an extension .feature

In user story(ticket), each and every requirement is called AC(Acceptance criteria)
